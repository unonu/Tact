# Tact
Hack RPI 2015 entry by Chris Vecchio, ALwin Joy, Jonathan Yax and Andrew Cage

# Idea
Tact is an app that aoutomatically adjusts your ringtone volume
based on the ambient noise level. It's like auto-brightness for
your ringtone!

For whatever reason, the app cannot initialise the microphone,
which causes the app to crash when it samples the microphone.
Feel free to fork it and fix the issue, otherwise I'm sure
this will fade into obscurity :(
